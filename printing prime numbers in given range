Program to find prime numbers in a given range is discussed here. A number is said to be prime if it is divisible by 1 and the number itself. Program to find prime numbers in a given range using loop

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of two integers. 

First integer corresponds to lower value.

Second integer corresponds to upper value.

Output consists of the prime numbers between the two intervals.

Sample Input: 
1
10

Sample Output:
2
3
5
7

solution:
low=int(input())
up=int(input())
for i in range(low,up+1):
    if(i>1):
        for num in range(2,i):
            if(i%num==0):
                break
        else:
            print(i)
