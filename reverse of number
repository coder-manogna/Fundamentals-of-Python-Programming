Write program to reverse a number is discussed here. We can reverse a number using loop and arithmetic operators in both iterative and recursive approaches. 

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of a integer.
Output consists of reversed input.

Sample Input: 
13579

Sample Output: 
97531

solution:
num=int(input())
n=num
rev=0
while(n>0):
    r=n%10
    rev=(10*rev)+r
    n=n//10
print(rev)
