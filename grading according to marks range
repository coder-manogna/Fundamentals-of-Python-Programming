The newly appointed Vice Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create a automated grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enter a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.

Write a program to solve the given problem.

 

Marks scored

Grade

100           S
(90,100)      A
(80,90)       B
(70,80)       C
(60,70)       D
(50,60)       E
<50           F 
The interval [a,b) includes all numbers greater than or equal to a and less than b.

Input and Output Format:
Input consists of a single integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student. Print Invalid Input if it is not in the range 0 to 100.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input 1:
85

solution:
m=int(input())
if(0<=m<=100):
    if(m==100):
        print("S")
    elif(90<=m<=99):
        print('A')
    elif(80<=m<=89):
        print('B')
    elif(70<=m<=79):
        print('C')
    elif(60<=m<69):
        print('D')  
    elif(50<=m<=59):
        print('E')
    else:
        print('F')
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
