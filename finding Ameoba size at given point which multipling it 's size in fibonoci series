The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. 
They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant.
If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.

Sample input and Output 1:
Enter the number of Months :
7
The amoeba size is 8

Sample input and Output 2:
Enter the number of Months :
12
The amoeba size is 89

solution:
mon=int(input("Enter the number of months :"))
i=0
a=1
b=2
if(mon==1):
    print("The amoeba size is 1")
while(b!=mon):
    sum=i+a
    i=a
    a=sum
    b+=1
print("The amoeba size is",sum)
